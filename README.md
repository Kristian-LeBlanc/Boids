# Boids
A C++ implementation of Craig Reynoldsâ€™s [Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids "Wikipedia") algorithm using the [One Lone Coders](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA "Youtube") [Pixel Game Engine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine "GitHub Repo")

Currently The boids follow the three rules stated in the boids algorithm:
- > Alignment
- > Seperation
- > Cohesion

The next step would be to impliment a [Quadtree](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Quadtree "Wikipedia") to improve Performance.
